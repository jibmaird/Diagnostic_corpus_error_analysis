T24	Characteristic 1445 1608	total number of CRB at the fovea and outside the fovea was 363 (63.7%) and 360 (63.2%), respectively, in FMTM and 428 (75.1%) and 426 (74.7%), respectively, in RLS
T27	Symptom 1873 1930	automated foveal center point thicknesses on FMTM and RLS
T26	Characteristic 1644 1816	RVO, the total number of CRB at the fovea and outside the fovea was 274 (87.8%) and 256 (82.1%), respectively, in FMTM and 287 (92.0%) and 270 (86.5%), respectively, in RLS

T1	Characteristic 10 27	retinal thickness
T2	Symptom 161 300	retinal thickness values generated by the fast macular thickness maps (FMTM) and customized 6-radial line scans (RLS) versus manual retinal

T10	Disease 615 618	RVO
T32	Symptom 2113 2342	RLS protocol provides fewer segmentation errors than the FMTM protocol, and its automated retinal thickness values (e.g., foveal center point, central subfield) correlate better with manual retinal thickness measurement than FMTM
