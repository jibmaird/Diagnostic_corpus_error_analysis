The

two

in

the

(

in
evaluating
the

was

Two

the
other
with

were
evaluated
.

Both
patients
had

N

There
can
be
significant
nerve

thin
##ning
in
patients
with
both
g

and
op

d

,
despite
the

in
these
patients
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
The
cup
margin
may
be
obscured
by
the

,
giving
rise
to
a
falsely
full

disk
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
In
such
cases
,
O
##CT
may
provide
a
useful
means
to
quantitative
##ly
measure
the
nerve
fiber

thickness
and
to
aid
in
the
management
of
these
patients
by
detect

thin

earlier

would
otherwise
be
possible
